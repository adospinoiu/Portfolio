    <p>Hi! My name is Alex Dospinoiu. If my last name is difficult to pronounce, (it is for many), think of it this way:
        Nice-To-Know-You ... Dos-pin-o-you. You'll get it right every time after that. I'm an engineer with a Masters &
        Bachelors from the University of Arizona. Bear Down Wildcats!</p>

    <p>I love the complexity and challenge of building components, completing sub-assemblies, then integrating them all
        into a finished working product. I think the same process applies whether building a physical product or a
        digital product ... getting the sum of the parts working together to function as a whole.</p>

    <p>In 2019 I decided I wanted to apply this love towards programming in addition to the physical manufacturing
        world. I started waking up everyday at 4 AM and teaching myself how to program starting with Python. In 2020 I
        took a Full-Stack Development Class through the University of Arizona. One of the best decisions I've made ...
        right up there with deciding to buy a 2005 Mustang as a pet-restoration-project ...</p>

    <p>Since the class I have continued adding to my software development skillset with a Data Analytics Professional
        Certificate (Google/Coursera) and independent projects I have taken on and completed for myself.</p>

    <p>I would love to dedicate my passion and efforts in software development in a professional setting as an Entry
        Level, Associate, or Junior Software Engineer. I'm confident I can make an impact, add value, and contribute to
        the growth of a team and the organization. "Comfort" usually results in stagnation and
        going-through-the-motions. "Discomfort" or an uncomfortable environment leads to growth of skillset and
        innovative ideas. I'm willing to be uncomfortable, to be the one in the room that doesn't know ... yet ... </p>
